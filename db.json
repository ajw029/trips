Its best-known attraction ‚Äì the famed Sonoma Wine Country ‚Äì is made up of various subregions, nearly¬†60,000 acres of vineyards, and more than 400 wineries.\nWhew! So how does one go about narrowing down the long list of options when planning their Sonoma vacation? Here‚Äôs my best advice: don‚Äôt overthink it!\nSonoma County as a whole just might be one of the most scenic places I‚Äôve ever visited, which means you truly can‚Äôt go wrong when choosing a ‚Äúhome base‚Äù city and corresponding winemaking region to explore. Some of the most popular regions to visit include:\nAlexander Valley: Nestled along the Russian River north of Healdsburg; known for its Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel,¬†Chardonnay, and Sauvignon BlancRussian River Valley: Located in the geographical heart of Sonoma County, with Santa Rosa and Sebastopol to the south and Healdsburg to the north; known for its¬†Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, and ZinfandelDry Creek Valley: Despite being just 16 miles by 2 miles, this region just outside Healdsburg has more than 90 wineries; known for its Zinfandel and Sauvignon BlancBennett Valley: Located south of Santa Rosa and west of the historic town of Glen Ellen; known for its¬†Merlot, Chardonnay, and¬†Cabernet SauvignonSonoma Valley: Situated in the southeastern corner of the county, this region is home to the small towns of Sonoma, Glen Ellen, and Kenwood; known for its Zinfandel,¬†Merlot, and Chardonnay\nWe opted for the Dry Creek Valley, both for its high concentration of wineries as well as for its laid-back reputation and many family-owned vineyards ‚Äì perfect for bringing along an energetic 6-month old puppy!\nFor us, Dry Creek Valley was the perfect introduction to Sonoma Wine Country.\nIt‚Äôs spectacularly scenic, compact, highly dog-friendly, conveniently located, and home to some truly world-class wines.

Our host Marie was extremely accommodating and absolutely lovely ‚Äì five stars all around.\nHowever, assuming that you‚Äôre planning your trip a bit farther in advance than we did, I‚Äôd recommend trying to find a pet-friendly Airbnb even closer to the charming town of Healdsburg, which has repeatedly been recognized as one of¬†America‚Äôs Best Small Towns.\nI love the look of this 2-bedroom garden house, just one mile from the town square. The property even has its own vineyard, orchard, and vegetable garden ‚Äì how sweet is that?! There‚Äôs also this adorable 1-bedroom cottage, which also has its own gardens, vineyards, and even chickens!\nFor something a bit more spacious, try this 3-bedroom house with a hot tub and fire pit in the backyard, or this charming 3-bedroom house¬†on 2 acres. Either would be perfect for families or a group of friends with their pups.\nAs for traditional dog-friendly hotels in Healdsburg, your options include the Best Western Dry Creek Inn, h2 hotel, and Hotel Healdsburg.

Despite an abundance of seating, there was just one patio table available when we arrived, which we happily snagged.\nUnlike Dutcher Crossing, Wilson was heavy on the reds ‚Äì¬†in fact, their menu was 100% Zinfandels. This time around, we opted to skip the tasting and purchased a bottle to share on the deck instead.\nCooper made plenty of friends here; not only were there other dogs visiting the vineyard with their families, but there were a handful of off-leash dogs (who I assume belong to the winery owners) who stopped by to say hello.\nAnd it‚Äôs safe to say the humans were a fan of his too ‚Äì one woman even asked if she could scoop him up and bring him over to her table, to show him off to her friends!\nAnother feature that sets Wilson apart from the pack?

David, who led our tasting, couldn‚Äôt have been any more knowledgeable, welcoming, or friendly.\nNeither Derek nor myself are wine connoisseurs by any means, but David made it easy to pick up on the subtle qualities of the wines we were tasting.\nWe also opted to add the cheese platter to our tasting experience. Mmmmm, cheese.\nBut while we certainly enjoyed our time at Amista, it was nothing compared to the absolute joy Cooper experienced. While I‚Äôm still not sure whether or not dogs are technically allowed to run off-leash at Amista, the staff let it slide so that Cooper could play with David‚Äôs German Shepherd, Bruno.\nThere were a few other dogs running free as well, which led to an all-out pup race around the property.

Many of the neighborhoods where these Airbnbs are located are right in the heart of the action, and the ones that are located in more quiet and residential areas (like ours was) often have their own local bars, restaurants, and convenience stores nearby.\nJust around the corner (literally!) from our Airbnb was a coffee and gelato shop, a taco stand, and several bars and restaurants.

Unlike some of the other more central beaches, it was very rocky and steep, and the sandy stretches of beach were quite small and spaced out. The views were absolutely out of this world‚Ä¶I practically had to keep pinching myself to prove that it was even real!\nWe were up with the sun on this day, so we snagged a prime¬†parking spot at La Jolla Cove (known for being one of the several beaches with an abundance of seals and sea lions).¬†From there, we walked south for several miles, checking out the various little beaches and jaw-dropping scenery along the way.\nIt was so fun exploring the area, climbing over boulders¬†and staring up at the rocky cliffs. It was honestly one of my most favorite travel days in recent memory, and I remember thinking that it was near impossible to give any of my worries and troubles a second thought when I was in a place as beautiful as that one.\nWe opted for lunch at George‚Äôs Ocean Terrace, which had some phenomenal seaside views and equally as impressive grub, before heading on to our next mini-adventure.\n","title":"La Jolla"},{"subsection":[],"images":[],"description":"We made it a priority to road trip up the coast to the little ocean-side town of Carlsbad, to see the ‚Äúfamous‚Äù flower fields.\nI had seen numerous swoon-worthy photos of the flower fields on Instagram (I mean, for a blogger, twirling photoshoots in a field of flowers is the stuff dreams are made of, right?) and after reading online that the fields spanned 50 acres, I was itching to snap a few Insta-worthy photos of my own.\nWhile ultimately I think my goal was achieved, overall I left the flower fields feeling slightly jipped. At $14 a pop, entrance to the flower fields didn‚Äôt come cheap. And once inside, I realized that getting that flawless photo wasn‚Äôt going to be as easy as I had assumed.\nYou‚Äôre not *technically* allowed in the fields, just next to them‚Ä¶which kind of put a damper on the whole ‚Äúfrolicking in the fields‚Äù scenario that had been playing out in my head.

The strong, dry Santa Ana winds blow south from the nearby deserts and across Southern California, causing the local vegetation and landscapes to be drier than they would normally be.\nThere are 8 trails available to hikers, some of which lead to stunning viewpoints, and others that bring you down to the Torrey Pines State Beach. Whichever trail you take, you‚Äôll be sure to be blown away by how wild and mystical the park feels, especially given its proximity to such a large city.\n","title":"Torrey Pines"},{"subsection":[],"images":[],"description":"I‚Äôll admit it; I hadn‚Äôt looked much into the Mission Beach area before arriving in San Diego. Looking back, this seems like such a rookie mistake. After all, Mission Beach is probably THE most iconic San Diego beach, and while I can‚Äôt say it was my favorite (that title belongs to La Jolla, that gorgeous gem) I definitely loved exploring it!\nBefore I get into the beach itself, let me just say this: I am ALL about California‚Äôs obsession with acai bowls. Like, yes. Just YES.\nWe had our first run-in with the beloved acai bowl at Amazona Acai Cafe (technically in Pacific Beach, but I‚Äôm giving it a shoutout¬†here anyways). Derek and I both got the Urbano bowl, which kept it simple and sweet with acai, granola, banana, strawberry, blueberry, and honey.\nI could probably definitely eat this everyday!\nMission Beach itself was exactly what I had hoped to find in a California beach. It was colorful and stereotypically beachy, with just the right amount (i.e. excessive amounts) of color, kitsch, nostalgia, and retro vibes.\nI half expected to see women in neon leotards, tights, and side ponytails rollerskating down the boardwalk, blasting upbeat 80‚Äôs tunes through their portable CD players.\nIn all honesty, I loved walking down the boardwalk and soaking in the fun and free atmosphere. The soft serve ice cream and snow cones, laid back beachfront bars and restaurants, families playing in the sand‚Ä¶and of course, Belmont Park.\nBelmont Park is a collection of rides, games, and one wooden roller-coaster located right off of the Mission Beach boardwalk. It‚Äôs free to go in and walk around, but you can purchase tickets for the rides and games.\nI loved the beachfront amusement park vibes; the sound of the rides whooshing past, kids throwing darts at balloons to win prizes, and all of the smiling faces.\nSo cheesy, so fun.\nWe decided to grab some food along the boardwalk, and wanted to find a place with good food, outdoor seating, and ocean views.\nEnter Cannonball.\nThis rooftop restaurant (are you sensing a theme here?) offered a mix of Asian, Californian, and seafood cuisine. We decided to keep in light for lunchtime by splitting two appetizers.\nThe seafood ceviche was the perfect combination of citrusy and spicy, and the shrimp and white fish mixed with onion and avocado was absolutely fabulous. We also ordered the ahi poke, which came with seaweed, cucumbers, avocado, and a deliciously tangy Asian flavor.\nWe both ordered the Water Cooler to drink: a light and refreshing combination of vodka, watermelon juice, lemon, and cucumber.\nAll in all, I loved every second of my time in San Diego. In my opinion, it‚Äôs a perfect weekend getaway destination no matter what you‚Äôre seeking. Food, drinks, sun, sand, surf, nature‚Ä¶it‚Äôs all there!\nFrom the kitsch and color of Mission Beach to the natural beauty of La Jolla and Torrey Pines, I fell head over heels for this pretty Southern California city. And when I left, I left knowing ¬†beyond a shadow of a doubt that¬†I‚Äôd return one day, and that San Diego would likely be one of those cities that would call me back again and again throughout my lifetime.\n","title":"Mission Beach"}]]}}
